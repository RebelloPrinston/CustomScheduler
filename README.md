----

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for the deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).
If your company wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled,
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who's involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement].

## To start using K8s

See our documentation on [kubernetes.io].

Take a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes].

To use Kubernetes code as a library in other applications, see the [list of published components](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/README.md).
Use of the `k8s.io/kubernetes` module or `k8s.io/kubernetes/...` packages as libraries is not supported.

## Key Concepts to Know about Kubernetes 
While the previous section provides links to documentation, below are some fundamental concepts to understand about Kubernetes that is useful when working with this repository: 
1. Cluster - consists of one or more master nodes and worker nodes
2. Pods - deployable units in Kubernetes that contain storage and network resources 
3. ConfigMaps - used to store non-sensitive configuration data, like environment variables
4. StatefulSets - used in certain full stack applications to manage data, ensuring successful deployments after changes that are made 

## Benefits of Integrating Kubernetes in application infrastructure 
Kubernetes automates deployment and management of containerized applications, which makes it more convenient for developers to redeploy changes made to the applications. 
Kubernetes helps efficiently use system resources by placing containers on nodes depending on needs of such resources. 
Kubernetes integrates well with CI/CD pipelines, common pipelines in the software industry. This allows for automated unit testing, building, and deployment of applications. 
As a result of this integration, Kubernetes minimizes cloud infrastructure costs due to the testing, building, and deployment processes being automated rather than manual. 

## To start developing K8s

The [community repository] hosts all information about
building Kubernetes from source, how to contribute code
and documentation, who to contact about what, etc.

If you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:

##### You have a working [Go environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make
```

##### You have a working [Docker environment].

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make quick-release
```

For the full story, head over to the [developer's documentation].

## Support

If you need support, start with the [troubleshooting guide],
and work your way through the process that we've outlined.

That said, if you have questions, reach out to us
[one way or another][communication].

## Community Meetings 

The [Calendar](https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/calendar/) has the list of all the meetings in the Kubernetes community in a single location.

## Adopters

The [User Case Studies](https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/) website has real-world use cases of organizations across industries that are deploying/migrating to Kubernetes.

## Governance 

Kubernetes project is governed by a framework of principles, values, policies and processes to help our community and constituents towards our shared goals.

The [Kubernetes Community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md) is the launching point for learning about how we organize ourselves.

The [Kubernetes Steering community repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering) is used by the Kubernetes Steering Committee, which oversees governance of the Kubernetes project.

## Roadmap 

The [Kubernetes Enhancements repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) provides information about Kubernetes releases, as well as feature tracking and backlogs.
